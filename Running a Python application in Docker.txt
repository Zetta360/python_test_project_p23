RUNNING A PYTHON APPLICATION IN DOCKER

0. Prerequisites:
Download Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/ and install. If installing on Windows, it may require enabling some Windows features.

1. Create a Docker file (a file named Dockerfile, with no extension) with the following contents:

FROM python:latest
WORKDIR /usr/src/myapp
COPY myapp.py .
CMD ["python", "myapp.py"]

2. Explanations:
- [FROM python:latest]
The first line states the base image that we are working with. It is essentially a Linux distribution on top of which the Python interpreter has been added.
- [WORKDIR /usr/src/myapp]
We create a new folder in the file system. This is where we place the Python` source code.
- [COPY myapp.py .]
We copy the source code - the file called myapp.py - into the current folder. The current folder is /usr/src/myapp and has been set at the previous step.
CMD ["python", "myapp.py"]
The Python interpreter is invoked with the file containing the program. The output is displayed on screen.

3. Build our custom Docker image:
> docker build -t vbocan/my-python-app .
The Docker system builds the image following the instructions set in the Dockerfile. The -t option assigns a tag to the image, in this case it is vbocan/my-python-app. You will need to change this for your particular case.

4. Instantiate the image and run the application in a container
> docker run --rm --name my-running-app vbocan/my-python-app
You should see the result of the program being written on the screen. The --rm option destroys the container as soon as it has finished running, otherwise you'd need to change the name of the container each time you run it.

5. Publish image to Docker Hub (optional):
The image may be published to your Docker Hub account. You need a free account with Docker Hub, then login using
> docker login -u <username>
Finally, push the image to Docker Hub
> docker push vbocan/my-python-app

Once published, the image is visibile to the world (provided that you make it public, private being the default) and anyone could execute it on their own machine.
That is the beauty of Docker deployment! Enjoy!
